## Introduction to ChatGPT Prompt Engineering

This repo covers a short course on prompt engineering and Instruction Tuned LLMs. You can access the content yourself on DeepLearning.org[https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/].

Two types of LLMs:
- base LLMs: Predict next word (like chatgpt), trained on the internet. Which means we can't expect reasonable answers to all our prompts.
- Instruction Tuned LLMs: Follow set of instructions and are built on top of base LLMs to be more specific. Fine tuning is done using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback(RLHF).
