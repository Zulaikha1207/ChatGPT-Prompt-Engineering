## Introduction to ChatGPT Prompt Engineering

This repo covers a short course on prompt engineering and Instruction Tuned LLMs. You can access the content yourself on [deeplearning.org](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/)

Two types of LLMs:
- Base LLMs: Predict next word (like chatgpt), trained on the internet. Which means we can't expect reasonable answers to all our prompts.
- Instruction Tuned LLMs: Follow set of instructions and are built on top of base LLMs to be more specific. Fine tuning is done using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback(RLHF).

Prompts should provide specific information, what tone to take on (professional's pov/ casual note), what source to get the information from and so on. For example,
if you want information about Alan Turing, it's useful to specify the context, i.e., do you want information about his personal life or scientific work, do you want it from wikipedia, etc..
In conclusion, make your prompts clear and specific.
